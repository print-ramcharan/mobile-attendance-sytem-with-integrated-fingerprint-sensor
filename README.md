# mobile attendance sytem with integrated fingerprint sensor
 deals with marking attendance through mobile phone using fingerprint sensor.
Hello this is Ram polabathina.
I'm currently pursuing my diploma in cse at Samskruti college of Engg & Tech.
I have started this "mobile attendance system with integrated fingerprint sensor" as a part of my project work.
Where this porject deals with students attendance marking with biometric authentication, viewing, and modifying etc., things.
First of all the lecturer will be login into a website with their credentials. Then it redirects to a main page where two QR codes will be visible one for to connect to the wifi and other for marking the attendance.
and they will also be able to access the students data too!
When it comes to student, we have a mobile application for them in which they have to login with their own credentials. 
Then when they are under the correct network, they should scan the QR which asks for fingerprint authentication and marks the attendance and they will be able to check it too.
we provided high security in the app to avoid multiple logins, false marking, etc things.
